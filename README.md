#### Is Holy Unblocker still being worked on?
Yes! A lot of users may have noticed the initial message about Holy Unblocker being down however Holy Unblocker is now being maintained by a seperate team and no longer by me. You may check it out <a href="https://git.holy.how/">here</a> once setup or join the TN Discord linked below for more information. 

#### Where can I find the new source material for Holy Unblocker?
Check it out <a href="https://github.com/holy-unblocker/website-aio">here</a> if you wish to have an easier to deploy instance with the new changes :D

#### Important Message (Original)
This isn’t the greatest announcement sorry. After lots of thought and severe hesitation I’m shutting down Holy Unblocker and leaving TN. It's just been something that I’ve been super conflicted with for months hence the lack of updates and the massive gaps that happened last year. I just didn’t want to throw away a project that I passionately enjoyed and spent time on while making amazing friends and meeting epic devs here. I could go on forever for who these people are but ima like leave it here. They know who they are :D

The main change of thought is that I’m finally just putting an end right now due to 1) the lack of motivation 2) the community is NOT the greatest at time and not the nicest at times (have to put that out here) 3) the future doesn’t look so good for HU/TN as a project.

Some things I’ll be keeping secret since there are more reasons to this choice unless otherwise for those who don’t find this enough information. Good friends here will know that I’ve been super stressed about this choice for months now. Also regardless a good motivator for this choice is the fact that I’ll be graduating soon.

It’s possible that I may continue/come back for this in the future or keep it on GitHub only. I leave this here because even now I am still doubting myself about this change. But for now I’d check out other proxy sites like Incognito (Duce DOES a ton of updates frequently and he is the creator/developer of Ultraviolet so give him some love) :yayy_hopi: 

Check out his Patreon also! For current HU patrons you will not be billed next month and the HU Patreon will be archived so head over to Duce’s patron so he can purchase more domains for Incognito.

With love <3

## Vauge Explanation for Beginners With External Proxies and Hosting
You will first want to host your proxies locally or externally. 

#### List of some good hosting options:
- <a href="https://dedipath.com">Dedipath</a> (Paid and Dedicated)
- <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> (Free)
- <a href="https://nodeclusters.com">NodeClusters</a> (Paid)
- <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a> (Free)
- <a href="https://repl.it">Repl.it</a> (Free)
- <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Azure</a> (Free and Paid)

Out of the list of hosting providers Heroku and NodeClusters rank first as a preference. You may also self-host.

After you have selected a decent VPS, use Cloudflare for the DNS records for both the site and the subdomains for the proxies.

This is an example of DNS records involving Heroku. Self-hosting will require `A records` preferably.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Holy-Unblocker/master/views/assets/img/dnssetup.png" width="500"></img>

- `@` and `www.example.ml` are being used for the local Ultraviolet proxy.
- `client.example.ml` is being used for Rammerhead.
- `a.example.ml` is being used for womginx.
- `cdn.example.ml` is being used for a private Ultraviolet host on the official sites.

As stated previously, Holy Unblocker is hosted locally with Ultraviolet.

#### Heroku Steps
So you chose to use Heroku to host. I personally favor it as a free choice.

- First obtain a card; (Prepaid, Debit, and Credit Cards work). You need this to add custom domains to your Heroku instance.

Make sure you connect your Heroku app to your GitHub and enable automatic deploys. Will make things easier. :) 

#### Freenom/Domain Steps
For beginners, Freenom is a good provider for obtaining domains for free. However the catch is that you can only use properly "Freenom" domains for free being .cf, .ml, .gq, ga and .tk. However these can be blocked rather easily.

- Get some Freenom domains then add them to your Heroku instance (Personal > [App Name] > Settings > Domains)
Add a domain for both `www.example.cf` and `example.cf` with .cf being interchangeable with other Freenom domain names.
- If you prefer to obtain premium domains (TLDs) then use <a href="https://porkbun.com">Porkbun</a>, which offers domains for amazing prices. Literally a `.net` domain normally costs around $10. On Porkbun for the first year it costs $3 so its definitely a deal.

#### Cloudflare Steps
- Use Cloudflare (make an account), add your site (Freenom Domain or other) and then add your various DNS targets to Cloudflare. Make sure you add Cloudflare's Nameservers which will be given later when you are adding your site. 

Make sure they are CNAME although A records also work and try to follow this structure:

**Type | Name | Target**

`CNAME | @ | your-main-heroku-target-here.herokudns.com`  
`CNAME | www | your-main-heroku-target-here.herokudns.com`

**Below are if you want external proxies also with your site:**

`CNAME | p | your-palladium-instance-here.herokudns.com`  
`CNAME | a | your-womginx-instance-here.herokudns.com`  
`CNAME | pd | your-pydodgeb-instance-here.herokudns.com`

Make sure HTTPS is forced and have SSL set to Flexible for Heroku. Otherwise you can have SSL set to Full.

#### Workspace Configurations 
Preferably if you have your own device use Visual Studio Code. Pretty much the best option you can get but obviously this is an opinion. Also make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> installed on your machine.

Not going to go too in depth with this part but first fork this repository. The clone it locally through a Terminal of some sort depending on what OS you are on. Make sure you navigate to the folder you want to set this up in.

```
git clone https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Holy-Unblocker.git

cd Holy-Unblocker

npm install
```

Now simply add the folder you cloned this repo in in VSC. Then run `npm install`. I recommend that if you are releasing this publically on GitHub that you add a `.gitignore` in your root directory with the following exclusions:

```
node_modules
```

Now you have your following workspace environment setup. To deploy the following workspace you just created you will need to look up depending on your hosting provider.

For an online IDE that you can use on your school computer and/or chromebook use GitPod. Basically the equivalent of Visual Studio Code but with in-browser support.
- Make an account: `https://gitpod.io/`
- Fork this repo and enter in this URL to setup your workspace: `https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/YourNameHere/Holy-Unblocker/`

Use the same steps above by running `npm install` in your repository and adding a `.gitignore` in your root directory specifying to exclude `node_modules`.

## Detailed FAQ
A detailed FAQ with common issues and solutions can be found <a href="https://holyubofficial.net/?faq">here</a> or on any official HU site on the FAQ page.

<details>
<summary>Quick FAQ</summary>

**Why is the site I am on not working correctly or having CAPTCHA errors?**

Captcha support is currently not available on all of the current proxies sadly. Therefore some sites may not work with any of the sites. Read below for issues with links on sites.

**I am getting 502 errors. What do I do?**

When this happens you may either switch sites to fix the error or wait a bit. Sometimes clearing your cache can help.

If you still have any questions feel free to ask them in the discord linked here.
